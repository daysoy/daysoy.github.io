<P class="lot_heading">Important Notice</P>
<P class="lot_text">	The Guide Price quoted must not be relied upon by 
prospective purchasers as a valuation or assessment of value of the property. It 
is intended to provide purchasers 	with an indication of the region at which the 
reserve may be set at the time of going to press. The guide price may be subject 
to variation and interested parties are 	advised to make regular checks for 
variations and should be aware that the reserve price may be either below or 
above the quoted guide price.	 <BR>	Prospective purchasers should also be aware 
that the eventual sale price may be above or below the guide level dependent 
upon competition, and should therefore not 	presume the guide to be indicative 
of the final expected sale price or the price the property is available at.
	 <BR>	When setting the guide price, the auctioneers have given consideration to 
the seller’s instructions in respect of their indicated reserve price at the 
time of instruction. 	The reserve price, (the level below which the property 
will not be sold), remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer. 
The guide price therefore, is intended 	to indicate the region at which the 
reserve price is intended to be set. The seller will confirm their final reserve 
price close to the auction date and if appropriate the 	auctioneers may adjust 
the guide price to reflect this.	 </P></DIV>
